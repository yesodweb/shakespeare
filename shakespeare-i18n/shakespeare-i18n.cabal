description:
    This package uses a compile-time, type-safe approach to create translated content. It has a simple syntax for translators, while allowing the full power of Haskell for applying complex grammar rules.
    .
    This package was spun off from yesod-core, and therefore the Yesod documentation is a good place to start in understanding this package. Please see <http://www.yesodweb.com/book/i18n> for more information.
